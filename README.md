# CSC-3380-Project

1) You have to download node.js, so that you can launch the projects and use a command called npm: you can find the download link here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2) Then either by directly downloading the code or using github desktop, you pull the repository onto your computer

3) You then download visual studio code and on the left bar there's this tab called extensions, download npm from there, you can find visual studio code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

4) Once you have visual studio code and npm downloaded, you then want to open the "project code" folder in vs code, the "project code" folder is in the repository that you pulled from github

5) You should now have all the code available on visual studio code, you then want to open two terminals within vs code and cd into the node-rest-api folder in one of the terminals and cd into the react-website-design folder in the other one

6) You now want to type npm start in both terminals, starting with the node-rest-api one, you then type npm install react-scripts --save into the react-website-design one and then npm start into it as well, so that the project opens up for you 

7) Everything should be set up now and you should be able to start coding and see the changes in real time. You need to repeat steps 5 and 6 every time you want to launch the project
